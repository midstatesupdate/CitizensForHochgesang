# Platform README

## Purpose
This document captures the current campaign platform narrative and issue framing for District 48 content production.

## Candidate Profile (Campaign-Provided)
- Candidate: Brad Hochgesang
- Office sought: Indiana State Senate, District 48
- Public issue leadership emphasis: Mid-States Corridor (MSC) opposition and local representation

## Core Representation Thesis
- The campaign position is that residents in District 48 are not currently being heard consistently in state-level decision-making.
- The campaign message emphasizes direct representation, constituent accountability, and local feedback loops.

## Mid-States Corridor Position
- Campaign stance: Oppose the Mid-States Corridor project in its current form.
- Campaign-reported organizing activities:
  - Public organizing against MSC
  - Public comments before county-level leadership
  - Letters to the editor
  - Eight town halls
- Campaign-reported poll detail to verify and cite before reuse:
  - A Public Policy Polling result indicating 81% opposition among Dubois County residents

## Governance and Accountability Framing
Campaign messaging currently centers on:
- Elected and appointed officials should be responsive to constituent input.
- One-party control can reduce accountability when public feedback is not integrated.
- Local trust is affected when major infrastructure decisions are perceived as non-transparent.

## Draft Platform Pillars
- **Representation First**: Prioritize constituent listening and measurable response.
- **Local Control and Transparency**: Ensure public infrastructure decisions are clearly communicated and accountable.
- **Community Protection**: Protect homes, neighborhoods, and local quality of life from poorly scoped projects.
- **Economic Practicality**: Focus on practical growth that aligns with local community priorities.

## Evidence and Verification Checklist
Before publishing definitive statements, verify and cite:
- Poll sponsor, methodology, field dates, sample size, and topline file
- Number/date/location of all town halls
- Dates and transcripts/records of county council remarks
- Published letters to editor with links/screenshots
- Public data source for governor approval ratings claim
- Public records for appointment history claims related to opponents and local officeholders

## Content Usage Rules
- Treat all campaign-provided factual claims as provisional until source-backed.
- Pair every numerical claim with a citation reference in draft copy.
- Use clear separation between opinion language and factual reporting.

## Next Refinement Inputs Needed
- Confirm final wording for candidate biography block
- Add source links for each listed action/event
- Add district-specific issue priorities beyond MSC (education, health care, local jobs, etc.)
