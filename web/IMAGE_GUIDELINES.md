# Image Guidelines

## Purpose
Ensure campaign images are consistent, legible, and performant across the site.

## Minimum Standards
- Hero / social image: 1200 x 630
- Square logo source: 2048 x 2048 preferred
- File formats: PNG or JPG (WebP allowed when available)
- Keep critical content inside center-safe area (~80%)

## Route Usage
- News cards/detail: use `coverImage`
- Event cards: use `scheduleImage`
- Media cards: use `thumbnail`
- Support cards: use `fundraisingLink.image`
- Press: source logo from `siteSettings.campaignLogo`

## Authoring Rules
- Add alt text intent when uploading important visuals
- Avoid embedding dense small text inside images
- Prefer high-contrast photos with clear subject focus
- Avoid heavy compression artifacts

## SEO and Sharing
- Pair each major story with a 1200x630 image
- Keep image filenames descriptive and stable
- Reuse official logo and visual style for consistent branding
