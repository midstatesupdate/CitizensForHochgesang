# .github Area

## Definition
Repository governance and agent-facing instruction area. Files here define how AI agents and automation should behave in this project.

## Contents
- [`copilot-instructions.md`](copilot-instructions.md): Canonical AI collaborator context, priorities, constraints, and doc index.
- [`workflows/web-quality.yml`](workflows/web-quality.yml): CI quality checks for lint/build/sanity verification/link and freshness checks.

## Maintenance Rules
- Keep instruction files concise, factual, and current.
- Add links to any new major docs created elsewhere in the repo.
- Update definitions when project scope changes.
